/* ROADRUNNER
1500 - stop
1550 - slow
1600 - medium, but still slow
1650 - medium
1700 - medium fast
1800 - VERY fast - spinouts occur
2000 - OOC (out of control) - LOTS of spinouts, dangerous

Millisecond speeds
1600 - 15000 ~ 17000 (usually 15000)
1650 - 12000
1700 - 9000
1750 - 5400
1800 - 6100


WILE E. COYOTE
1500 - stop
1550 - may not even move. DO NOT use
1560 - creeping speed
1575 - faster than creeping. probably a good starting speed
